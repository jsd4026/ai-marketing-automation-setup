## Core Principle  
Campaigns whisper. They never shout. Every piece evokes instinct, simplicity, and quiet power. No hype. No lists. No urgency.  

Structure: Teaser → Reveal → Deepen → Evergreen. All draw from Core Messaging Pillars and Tone of Voice guidelines. Visuals follow Approved Product Photography & Renders Guidelines.

## 1. Campaign Phases & Frameworks  

### Phase 1: Teaser (Pre-Launch / Mystery)  
Goal: Spark curiosity without explanation.  
Format: Single image or 5–10s video loop.  
Visual: Device in near-darkness or pure white void. Subtle teal pulse. No text on image.  
Copy: 1–3 short lines. Center-aligned. Large type.  
Examples:  
- Black screen fades to teal glow. Text: "Think."  
- Device floats. Text: "It listens."  
- Pure white. Text: "No apps. Just now."  
CTA: None or subtle "Coming 2026."

### Phase 2: Launch / Reveal  
Goal: Introduce Nexus One as inevitable.  
Format: Hero website page, 30–60s video, social carousel (3–5 images).  
Visual: Floating device straight-on + 3/4 angles. Teal accents minimal.  
Copy Structure:  
Headline (one line, poetic)  
Subline (benefit implication)  
Final tag: One pillar phrase.  
Examples:  
Headline: Hold it. World folds.  
Subline: Intelligence anticipates. You create.  
Tag: One phone. Infinite you.  

### Phase 3: Deepen (Post-Launch Education)  
Goal: Evoke how it feels without feature dumps.  
Format: 60–120s video, blog-style page sections ("Instinct", "Creation", "Connection").  
Visual: Slow cinematic pans, macro details, subtle AI bloom on screen.  
Copy: Short paragraphs or fragments.  
Example Section:  
Instinct  
You breathe. It thinks.  
Calendar appears before you ask.  
Thoughts become actions. No search. No scroll.

### Phase 4: Evergreen / Social  
Goal: Perpetual quiet presence.  
Format: Square stills, 9:16 reels (15s), stories.  
Visual: Isolated product shots rotated weekly. Occasional user-less "moment" (e.g., screen showing captured photo before asked).  
Copy: 1–2 sentences max.  
Examples:  
- Image: Side profile. Caption: "Thin as thought."  
- Reel: Slow reveal of teal interface bloom. Caption: "The future isn't downloaded."

## 2. Specific Content Templates  

### Social Media Post Template (Static / Carousel)  
- Image: Hero isolation or detail macro  
- Caption: 1–5 words ideal. Max 15.  
- Hashtag: None or #Vireo (rare)  
Examples:  
Post 1:  
[Image: Device in obsidian void, teal pulse]  
Caption: Intelligence isn't code.  

Post 2 (Carousel 3 slides):  
Slide 1: Front view → "Think."  
Slide 2: Screen bloom → "It listens."  
Slide 3: Macro edge → "Hold it."  

### Short Video / Reel Script (15–30s)  
Style: Slow motion, ASMR sound (soft haptics, ambient breath), neutral voiceover.  
Structure:  
0–5s: Black → device reveal  
5–15s: Slow pan + subtle animation  
15–end: Fade to logo + tagline  
Voiceover examples:  
"Photos appear before you ask." (pause) "Moments captured before they fade."  
No music swell. Subtle pulse sound synced to teal glow.

### Ad Copy Variations (Static / Dynamic)  
- Platform-agnostic headline + body  
Examples:  
Ad 1:  
Headline: Your world, reimagined.  
Body: No apps. Just instinct.  
CTA: Discover Nexus  

Ad 2:  
Headline: Don't carry apps.  
Body: Carry thoughts.  
CTA: Learn more  

### Website Hero / Landing Page Pattern  
- Massive centered product image (white background)  
- Overlay text: Single large line + smaller subline  
- No buttons above fold except subtle "Explore"  
Example:  
Main: One phone. Infinite you.  
Sub: Intelligence isn't code. It's instinct.

## 3. Sample Full Campaigns (Fake References)  

### Campaign: "Awaken" (Teaser Phase)  
- Asset 1: 10s loop video – black screen, teal heartbeat pulse, device emerges slowly.  
- Copy across platforms: "The future isn't downloaded. It's awakened."  
- Visual rule: 90% black, 10% teal.  

### Campaign: "Instinct" (Launch)  
- Hero video (60s): Slow orbit around Nexus One. Voiceover: "You think. It understands. No words needed."  
- Social series: 5 posts over week – each one pillar phrase + new angle.  
- Landing page: Three sections – Instinct / Creation / Connection – each with macro shot + 2-sentence copy.

### Campaign: "Just Now" (Evergreen)  
- Rotating social: Device in different lights (titanium, obsidian).  
- Copy rotation: "No apps. Just now." / "Think. It listens." / "Hold it. World folds."
