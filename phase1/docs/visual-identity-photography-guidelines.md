## Core Principle  
Every image must feel like silence made visible. The product exists alone in a world of perfect calm. No distractions. No noise. Let the device speak through presence, not explanation.

All photography and 3D renders exist to evoke instinct over information.

---

## Equipment & Technical Specs  
- Primary camera: ARRI Alexa 75 or equivalent cinematic sensor (or high-end 3D render pipeline matching ARRI look)  
- ISO: Native low (base 800 or lower) for clean shadows  
- Aperture: f/2.8 – f/4 for shallow depth of field  
- Shutter: 1/1000s or equivalent in render (freeze subtle motion if any)  
- Lighting: Natural window light preferred; soft diffused sources only. No hard key lights.  
- White balance: 5500K–6500K (cool, clean titanium feel)  

Renders: Use physically-based rendering (PBR). Match real-world material properties: titanium matte/brushed, glass subtle reflectivity, no exaggerated specular highlights.

---

## Color Palette in Imagery  
- Dominant: Pure white (#FFFFFF), Obsidian black (#333333)  
- Secondary: Soft fog/mist gray gradients  
- Accent: Teal Pulse (#00A0FA) — used once per frame only (e.g., subtle AI glow on screen edge, lens reflection, or boot animation hint). Never dominant.  
- No saturated colors elsewhere. No colored backgrounds unless pure black/white/fog.

---

## Composition & Framing Rules  
- Product floats or rests minimally — no visible stands, hands, or supports in hero shots  
- Isolation is mandatory: Subject against infinite white, obsidian void, or soft atmospheric fog  
- Angles (priority order):  
  1. Straight-on hero (centered, symmetrical)  
  2. Subtle 3/4 front (slight angle for dimension)  
  3. Macro/close-up on details (camera array, edge, power button, teal pulse)  
  4. Side profile (ultra-thin profile emphasis)  
  5. Back view (triple camera module centered)  
- No overhead flat-lays unless packaging  
- Crop ratios:  
  - Hero stills: 1:1 square or 4:5 vertical  
  - Social/reels: 9:16 vertical  
  - Website deep dives: 16:9 cinematic  
- Depth of field: Always shallow. Background softly blurred to dreamlike quality. Focus falls strictly on device.  

Forbidden:  
- People or body parts (except ultra-rare silhouette for scale — no skin visible)  
- Reflections of crew/environment  
- Busy scenes or lifestyle staging  
- Text overlays on photos (copy lives outside image)

## Key Shot Types & Examples  
1. **Hero Isolation** — Device centered in white/obsidian void. Soft natural light from side. Teal hint on screen if active.  
2. **Detail Macro** — Camera lenses, titanium texture, power button haptic area. Extreme close-up, razor focus.  
3. **Ambient Glow** — Screen showing subtle AI bloom (holographic interface emerging). Teal pulse visible but restrained.  
4. **Profile Edge** — Emphasize thinness. Device angled against black, light catching edge.  
5. **Packaging Reveal** — White magnetic box open, velvet tray, phone emerging slowly. Clean lines, no clutter.  

---

## Post-Production Rules  
- Minimal grading: Slight contrast lift, shadow recovery for depth  
- No heavy vignettes, grain, or effects  
- Color correct to match palette exactly  
- Export: 16-bit TIFF master, then compressed PNG/JPG for web  
- File naming: vireo-nexus-hero-white-01.png (descriptive, consistent)

---

## Reference Visual Feel  
Images should evoke the same quiet luxury as the device itself: precise, intentional, almost meditative.

This guide pairs directly with the Core Brand & Voice Foundations and Visual Identity sections.

It's instinct.
